## About SignMeHub

SignMeHub is a site used to help for example teachers moderate an event that requires signing up. A workshop day would be an excellent example to this. Admins configure everything, and users will be able to sign up for the workshops. We strive to make the whole process as easy as possible, so every student or elderly person will be able to sign up without any problems.

## Features

- **Signing up:** *Sign up to workshops or anything else using our tools*
- **Checking workshops:** *Use our home page to view the workshops you signed up to*
- **Set-up permissions:** *Set up the permissions for your admins and users as superadmin*

## Getting Started

1. **Logging in:** *Enter your username and password on the log-in page*
2. **Explore:** *Feel free to try signing up to various workshops, or to take a look at your schedule on the designated page*
3. **Customize:** *As admin, edit your users and their permissions to give them the best possible experience*
